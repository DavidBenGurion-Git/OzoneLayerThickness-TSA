# OzoneLayerThickness-TSA
A well detailed Time Series Analysis on Ozone Layer Thickness.

To perform the whole time series analysis, model fitting and specification, 
we use **RStudio** with the R-language version **4.0.5** along with other necessary packages like tinytex, knitr, 
TSA and tseries and various other plotting techniques to visualize our data. 
The model fitting and prediction tasks from our Chapter 1 make use of the linear regression function **lm()** and the **predict()** function respectively. 
For model specification in Chapter 2, we use various transformation and differencing techniques along with various tools from the **tseries** package like unit root tests, 
EACF and BIC tables and ACF and PACF plots which serve as appropriate model specification tools to aid us in our task to propose a set of possible and appropriate ARIMA(p,d,q) models.
